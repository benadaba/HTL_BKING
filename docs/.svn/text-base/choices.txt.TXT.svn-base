- The serialVersionUID ;

I declared this value manually. This will ensure consistency in the value during serialization and deserialization even 
after slight changes in the HotelRoom class. Because if i had allowed the compiler to generate it automatically the 
serialVersionUID value would change any time there is a slight modification in the HotelRoom class. This will make my 
modified classes incompatible with the original class during deserialization resulting in an
invalidClassException exception being thrown.


 >>> HotelRoom class.

All fields are declared as String including the size, rate and date 

Reason/advantage. 
Gives uniformity, and ease of management particularly when the record fields in the database file are stored as 
String array.



There are no setter methods for name,location, smoking, rate, size, date ariables because there are no places in the 
application where the client is going to set these variables. These variables and their values are already created and
established in the database file, hence we are only to read and get these values. So only getters methods are provided 
for these variables in the HotelRoom class.

The only variable whose value our client has the opportunity to set is the owner (ownerID) that is during the booking process.
Hence the appropriate setter method is provided for it.

Hence during the construction of a hotel room object, all the appropriate values are obtained from the database file and the 
client is only allowed to set the owner (ownerID) value when they are booking for the record.

The advantage  is that, it makes the code simple 
2) it reserves a lot of memory and space.

There are constants which are used as indexes when the HotelRoom object is converted to an array and its field values
are being accessed.


The class has two  methods getTitle, which gets the fields(variables') title as string seperated by commas and getFields method
which gets the field(variables') values of this hotel room object separated by comma.
These methods are called in various parts of the application specifically the getTitle method is called in the 
ApplicationWindow class whenever a new HotelRoomTableModel is been instantiated.

advantages of these static fields and these methods are.
1) they make the code cleaner as one would not have to be coding all these fields one after the other in all parts of the 
   application.
2) they make it simpler to maintain the code because if there is any change necessary we just change the source,
, that is, these methods and fields without having to break our other parts of the code.


disadvantage.
1) increases coupling, hence if the HotelRoom class becomes non-existent again , the other parts  of our code which call
these methods  and constants would break.


This class overrides class Object's equals and hashCode methods which are used to make comparisons during the booking process.
That is to determine if a room selected to be booked is equal to a room in the database file by comparing all the field values
with the exception of the owner field because that has no value assigned to it. 



Design decision in Data class implementation.
1)  Implemented Data class to an interface. (Programmed to an interface).
   
   advants of coding to an interface.
1. Helps to overcome some  limitations of the methods given by Sun(what are these limitations, state them)
2) 

Extended sun interface and coded to an interface.
advants: 
1. flexible and easily maintinable in the future.
2. Not harded coded and in future any subclass that implements the ExtendedInterface can be 
   implemented straight away without having to change a lot of code.

 __ the getHotelRoomList() method implemented in the Data class returns all records including those marked deleted.
   the reason is that the deleted records still have a place in the database and hence have record Numbers
   associated with them. 
advants. 1) returning them makes it easier to trace every record by record Number with much ease.
          than it would have been if deleted records had to monitored so that their recNo numbers are 
          ignored anytime there is a such in the database whiles those records actually occupy space,

         2)
         3)

Search and updated directly to the database file 

advants.
1) Saves time that has to be spent to update the database after all dealings when using a cache.
2) Any point in time what however the database file is presented is the up-to-date state of it.
   this is because it is instantly update there and then when an operation occurs on it.
3) It is an easy approach for junior programmers who would not know much about the technicalities of caching.

***) Used a HashMap to store the list of records returned from the database.
 --     Map stores the hotel room records as values and the corresponding record numbers in the database file

B) in DB.
Data  - 
  - used RandomAccessFile because makes it convenient and easy to access the database file from different offsets randomly.
  - made local cos tis not serializable but it will be carried over a network since that LocalClient object has a reference
to it ; alternate approach
advants  -1) this makes it easy to read and write to the database file.
          2) 

- Used ReentrantLocks with its  -   ReentrantReadWriteLock and Condition classes

advantages.
1) It offers features like lock polling, timed lock waits, and interruptible lock waits. 
2) Additionally, it offers far better performance under heavy contention. 
  (In other words, when many threads are attempting to access a shared resource, the JVM will spend 
 less time scheduling threads and more time executing them.) 
This means that when many threads are all contending for the same lock,
 the total throughput is generally going to be better with ReentrantLock than with synchronized
3) it can do everything synchronized does, has the same memory and concurrency semantics
4) Lock objects have the ability to back out of an attempt to acquire a lock unlike implicit locks. (though this feature is 
 not used in my implementation).



other alternative. normal synchronization with monitor methods and statements.
advants.
1) Synchronization requires that locks be released in the same stack frame in which they were acquired, 
  which most of the time is the right thing 
2) and interacts nicely with exception handling
3) For one, it is impossible to forget to release a lock when using synchronization; 
	the JVM does that for you when you exit the synchronized block.


disadvantages
synchronization is good, but not perfect.
1)it is not possible to interrupt a thread that is waiting to acquire a lock,
2) it is not possible to poll for a lock or attempt to acquire a lock without being willing to wait forever for it.


    -

2) created local instances of RandomAccessFile in each of the methods that contain reading or writing to the database file.
   this is because RandomAccessFile is not serializable and hence cannot be transported over the network when running in the
   networked mode. 
   It is thus created locally and disposed off after method finishes running particularly when running the server mode.

>>> Methods 
   Delete
A record is unlocked before it is deleted. Thus the unlock method is called first from within the delete
 method before a delete takes place. Because if the client does not have the legitimate right to the right cookie, they
cannot unlock that record, which will through a SecurityException, let alone deleting it.
   
Seeks the start of the record to be deleted and writes deleted at the start of the position.
It can be enhanced in the future though.

   advantages.
  1) All the other records maintain their same locational numbers in the database, hence reference to them by such numbers
    is maintained and made easier.
   
2) It is an easier and straight forward approach.

  other means by which it could have been done.
  >>>could have deleted the entire record with all its fields and the next record aligned to occupy the locational space 
     and number of the deleted record, in the database.

    advants. 
    1) creates more space.

    disadvantages.
     2) rewriting of records to align with locational positions and tedious and may be bugs prone.

 readRecord method.
- an inner class is created to assist in converting from the one large byte[] into multiple
 String[] - one String per field.  It was an inner class because that class is used for that sole purpose and used only in 
that method.


update method
In the update, A record is unlocked before it is updated. Thus the unlock method is called first from within the update
 method before an update takes place. Because if the client does not have the legitimate right to the right cookie, they
cannot unlock that record, which will through a SecurityException, let alone updating it.



findByCriteria method.
- used ArrayList to hold internally, the record numbers of the found record numbers from the search.
Reasons./advants of ArrayList.
1).

create method
If -1 is returned from the create method, it means that there was no new data inserted to be created
 so there was no need to go ahead to create and empty record. When the end of file is reached without 
finding a deleted entry, the new record is written to the end of the database file.

lockRecord method
- used System.currentTimeMillis() multiplied by new Random().nextLong()
This provides a more unique cookie.
advantages
1) It is native 
2) Its resolution (or granularity) depends on the underlying OS 
3) It generally has a very fast response time 
4) The method signature is not synchronized but the implementation usually is 

disadvantages.

other options.
System.nanoTime();
and the current Threads ID.



Unlock method.
//If record number is not in the HashMap (that is, it is not locked) or the record number is not
        // associated with the correct cookie then throw a SecurityException.


 
  - Used RandomAccessFile to read and write to the database file.
advantages.
1)The real advantage of random access files is as their name implies, once they are opened, they can be read from or
 written to in a random manner just by using a record number 
2)You can even add to the end of the file since you will know how many records are in the file. 
3) RandomAccessFile takes advantage of particular behaviours that are not found in normal I/O devices
  With RandomAccessFile, you can seek to any desired location in the file then read and/or write the desired amount of data.

disadvantages.
1) You have to manually, arithmatically calculate the position in the file you want to read or write to and seek it with the
  seek method of the RandomAccessFile.
  


other alternative. 
other I/O devices like BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream, FileInputStream and FileOutStream.
Main disadvantage is they will not offer you random access to any position of choice in the database file.


- Used HashMap to store the generated cookies from the lockRecord method.
   recordNumbers are keys whiles cookies are associated values in the map.

advantages of using hashMap.
1)  A hashmap is not synchronized and faster than hashtable.????
2)One other minor advantage of HashMap over Hashtable is that it allows null
both as a key and a value. Hashtable does not.
3)Repopulating a HashMap offsets the performance gained by avoiding synchronized accessor methods.)
4)Effectively, the HashMap is immutable. This allows multiple get operations to run in parallel, which can be a major performance boost

HotelRoom
   i) no setters for all fields except ownerID because these fields should not be editable with the exception of ownerID.
   2) they are read-only and hence the values are set during construction time in the constructor.

	Date is stored as String object and not date object cause it makes it easier for all the fields to contained in a
    String array later on.

   4) data type of the rate variable is String, this makes it easier to manage the currency symbol ($)

Equality of HotelRooms
 To check that two or more HotelRooms are equal the overridden equals method is used. All the field variables as in the 
case of hotel name, location, size, smoking, rate, and date are compared for with the exception of ownerid because by 
creation their are empty/null.


DBClient;
 An interface which is called by the Client when searching or booking for hotel rooms.
 Provides methods which will be called in the GUI in either of the running modes; either through the
  server or local connection.

Made this an interface for various reasons.


advantages;
1.you could later change your code, that is

If there is any subclass of LocalClient or any other class the implements the DBClient
 they can be changed in place of where the DBClient reference is found and this will not break the code,
 unlike when it is being implemented to a concrete class
example  LocalClient client = new LocalClient 
in the future if the implemented interface changes then the code would break


2.an interface gives you more abstraction, and makes the code
more flexible and resilient to changes, because you can use different
implementations of the same interface without changing its client.

3  Easy Maintenance

4.Reusable Code, Plug-Compatible
When you use an interface, you lower the bar to potential class interactions, and hence reusability. 

5 Compilation Efficiency
Programming to an interfaces helps in large projects
 in case you changed one of the method signatures of LocalClient, all the code that calls that method has to be recompiled 
too. If you use the DBClient interface, and don’t change the interface, changing just the interface implementation classes,
LocalClient,  nothing need be recompiled, so long as those classes accessed via the DBClient interface name 
rather than specific class name(LocalClient).


disadvantages
1) You can’t specify static methods in the interface. All interface methods are instance methods.
  Hence if any implementing class needs a static method then it will have to declare their own static methods.


The getHotelRoomsByCriteria method in the DBClient returns  an Object[][]  which contains Hotel rooms in the form of
String array. The JTable in the view uses Objects in its rows and columns hence it makes it straight forward when a search
returns the results in Object array to be used by the HotelRoomTableModel.


All the methods in the DBClient throw IOExceptions.
reasons and advantages.
1) When running in networked mode and the server is disconnected, then this Exception will be thrown and it will be
  propagated to further throw the RemoteException in the Application ???


LocalClient 

It implements DBClient and implements of its methods.

It is good to programme to an interface, in  that

DBClient client = new LocalClient(String dbPath);

If there is no database file passed into the constructo to load to application then there is no need to continue running 
the application so the Application exits.
This is not expected to happen, anyway, because the client is forced to select the database file when starting the mode 
in which to run the application.


disadvantages.

A)Booking - if a record is already booked and you try to book it again, you are given once chance to see whether you are the 
       owner( one rebooking chance,) 
if you are
   then you can rebook with same ID.
if you are not,
   then System would not allow you.

When you try it once and you are allowed or not allowed , you would not be given the chance to try to book again.
A message would be directly shown telling you whether room is not available or you cancelled your booking.
if another user else tries this chance on a different system else where, that one chance is cancelled whether or not it was 
the real owner. In such case, any one who wants to rebook again on that same booked room should call the Hotel.
This is for security reasons among other reasons.



RecordNotFoundException
It is declared public because it is being thrown at the server too????

>>> The 48 hour Rule.





RECORD CACHE AGAINST WRITING TO THE FILE DIRECTLY.
 Records are cached into a HashMap the first time they are loaded to the view.
 Records are then accessed and managed from the cache and updating the physical database file appropriately.

 advantages.
  1) It prevents the tedious process of always writing and reading directly from the physical database on each operation
       hence less tedious.
  2) It helps prevents such problems as IOExceptions in the reading and writing directly to the file.

other alternative.
  Could have written and read directly to the database file on each single operation.

advantages.
 Would not have to write back to the file after all the operations are complete since each single operations deals directly 
 with the file and keeps it updated in time.  

disadvantages.
   Very tedious process.

Used HashMap to cache:

Why hashMap is declared static, to allow all instances to have, access and update one common map.
advantages.
  1) random access
   2) fast access ????

disadvants

other data types.
  


IN DB IN GENERAL.
 the data and local client class are programmed to interfaces, DBAccess, and DBClient respectively.
Data class implements DBAccess directly.
advants.

disadvants


advantages
1)In this sense, if in the future other subclasses of DBAccess and DBClient can be used in places where the interfaces are referenced.
2)When the interfaces change, not much of our code will have to be changed ????.
3). Program becomes implementation-independent.
  If the client of particular component references DBAccess by its API then the client gets more flexible since it does not
   have to change to use another implementation of the DBAccess.  ?????



GUI 
 JTable -  It is appropriate to show ownerIDs cos tis the only way the CSRs would know about them. For the clients, they
            already know about them.


GENERAL ACHITECTURE
MVC pattern is used in design.

Model = database file.

Data class is responsible for extracting the information stored in the datafile in the form of bytes and converting it to
 a String.
        -It is also responsible for converting String into bytes in inputing them into the database file in the way it is 
          stored in the datafile.


Contoller = DBClients(LocalClient)
         - Responsible for converting the String obtained from the Data class into HotelRoom objects and carrying the information
      to the GUI.
         _ It is also responsible for taking information from the GUI in the form of HotelRoom objects and converting them into 
         String and sending it to the Data Class which in turn converts it to bytes and use it to look into the database for 
      for the required information
     - The controller is the logic of the application.
     -makes sure what what is passed to the Data class and for that matter the database file is in the right format.
       and what ever is presented to the GUI is in the right format.
     
     >>>>>>>More.

View = GUI (JTable)


Factory Pattern 
  - used in the RemoteConnector

All numberings start with zero.
- this follows java numbering standards 
hence the first record in the database file is numbered 0 and the second is numbered 1 and the third 2 and so on...


ALONEOPTIONDIALOG.

APPLICATION RUNNER ........ (NONE).

APPLICATIONWINDOW (DOne)
 - the DBClient reference passed into the constructor of the Application allows the appropriate instance of the running
   mode, eithe networked or non networked to used to instantiate the internal reference to the DBClient.

  >>> In the actionPerformed method of the ExitApplication Inner class, the JOptionPane is used ask the user if they 
   actually wants to close the application when the click exit from the file menu.

advants. It might have been a mistake through which the user clicked the exit item, given them such a question helps to cancel
 the exit and continue with their searches and bookings.
   Or user might have a second thought of doing something again after clicking exit. Giving them this option allows them to 
   get back to the application without having to exit and run the application all again.

 >>>In the searchRooms method when a search is done a new HotelRoomTableModel is created to get data from search result
 and the application's internal table's model is set to new HotelRoomTableModel.
 In this sense, old table model will eventually become eligible for garbage collection and it will be garbage collected 
 when the garbage collector runs.

USER INSTRUCTIONS.  
 Read and display from the GUI in addition to it being put inside the docs directory.
- Read using the HotelRoomBookingApplicationInstruction class.

1)could have put online as HTML file.

advantages of displaying in GUI.
 - makes it more handy,
  - user friendly
  - professional
  - easily accessible and run with application.


Advantages of having put it online as HTML file would have been wide accessible by many users.

Could have used JDialog to display instructions but the instructions are too long which will result in a 
rather huge dialogue making the gui too clumsy.
 

HOTELROOMTABLEMODEL

OWNERIDDIALOG.
1) extended a JDialog
  advantages.
  a) It is either you book or don't hence there would not be any need to minimize the window as it would have been

3) Uses a JFormattedTextField to accept owner ID inputted by the user.
   With the aid of MaskFormatter to specify valid and number of individual inputs into the textFields.

 bookRoom method.

  >> Whenever a booking activity is processed a new  HotelRoomTableModel instance is created and the table's model is

Why that way.
advants and disadvants.   
   This new creation does not however happen when the client is disconnected from the server when running in networked mode
